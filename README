Timisoara Public Transport

Scrapes public transport information from the official transport 
authority web site (times, stations, connections) and displays it
conveniently on your device.

This application is about utility, it has an spartan interface, 
no bells. no whistles, no google maps or GPS required. It is 
designed after my own requirements:
- show me vehicle arrival times
- show me my connections at the next station

Required permissions:
- internet access - the time are obtained from http://www.ratt.ro/txt
- sd-card write - a cache with transport line and station information
is saved on the external storage.
